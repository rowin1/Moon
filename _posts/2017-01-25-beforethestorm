*Before the Storm* is a boardgame based on World of Warcraft that I developed to play with my friends. It gets it namesake from World of Warcraft Patch 2.0.1 that added Arenas to the game. Here is a quick overview of the game and how it works.  

## Introduction

*Journey to Blade's Edge Arena and battle against gladiators in a 2v2 fight to the death.*

## Overview

The game is a turn-based PvP skirmish that requires two teams, each with two characters. Each player controls a separate character, and has a deck of ability cards specific to their class. Players take turns until one of the teams is eliminated. 

Every turn, the active player draws a card from their ability deck and is allotted 3 action points they may choose how to spend.
* Movement on the game board requires 1 action, and allows the player to move two tiles. 
* Abilities have an action cost and a class resource cost(mana, energy, rage, focus). Abilities also have a type, such as melee or spell, that determines the conditions a player must meet in order to use the ability. Spell abilities require the character to have at most 6 tiles in between him and their target. Melee abilities require a chararcter to be at a tile adjacent to their enemy.

## Character Classes
There are currently 5 implemented classes:
* Hunter
* Mage
* Priest
* Rogue
* Warrior

## Component Overview

### Game Board
The board represents Blade's Edge Arena. The hexagonal grid represents locations that characters may move. 

### Tokens
These tokens are placed on top of character sheets to track current health and resource values.

### Dice
The dice is used to determine the outcome of certain events that have a chance to occur, such as Frostbolt having a 1/6th chance of freezing a target in place for one turn.

### Figures
Each character is represented by a figure, which is placed on the game board to indicate its current position.

### Character Sheets
Each character class has a corresponding sheet that shows class specific information, such as statistics, base abilities, and how much mana they regen per turn.

### Class Ability Cards
Each character has a corresponding deck of ability cards that are specific to their class.
